RevolutionarySecuritySystem
A cutting-edge security framework for anomaly detection, secure logging, and workflow automation.
Overview
The RevolutionarySecuritySystem integrates quantum-resistant cryptography, AI-driven anomaly detection, and transformer-based natural language processing to provide a robust solution for secure system monitoring and automation. It includes:

QuantumTCCLogger: Tamper-evident logging with lattice-based signatures and zero-knowledge proofs, stored on IPFS for decentralized integrity.
RevolutionarySecuritySystem: Neural network-based anomaly detection for time-series data, replacing traditional FFT methods.
generateWorkflow: Transformer-based parsing of natural language commands into validated workflows.

Features

Quantum-Resistant Logging: Uses lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs for secure, future-proof audit trails.
AI Anomaly Detection: Employs a TensorFlow neural network to detect anomalies in signals, adaptable to complex patterns.
NLP Workflow Generation: Parses natural language inputs into structured workflows using a transformer model.
Decentralized Storage: Logs stored on IPFS for tamper-proof, distributed access.
Extensible Commands: Supports custom commands like analyze for ML-based operations.

Installation

Install Node.js and required dependencies:npm install crypto fs ajv @tensorflow/tfjs-node ipfs-core


Install hypothetical libraries (replace with actual implementations):npm install quantum-resistant-crypto zero-knowledge-proof natural-language-transformer


Place schema.json in the project root for workflow validation.

Usage
const { RevolutionarySecuritySystem } = require('./RevolutionarySecuritySystem');

async function main() {
  const system = new RevolutionarySecuritySystem();
  const input = `
    set x to 0
    repeat set x to x + 1 3 times
    wait 2 seconds
    set y to x * 5
    analyze signal with neural_net
    return y
  `;
  const result = await system.runAudit(42, input);
  console.log('Audit Result:', result);
  await system.logger.save();
}

main();

Command Syntax

set <variable> to <value>: Assigns a value or expression to a variable.
`repeat   timesวิต

System: times`: Executes a command n times in a loop.

wait <n> seconds: Pauses execution for n seconds.
return <value>: Returns a specified value.
analyze <input> with <model>: Performs ML-based analysis on input.

Example Input
set counter to 0
repeat set counter to counter + 1 3 times
wait 2 seconds
set result to counter * 5
analyze signal with neural_net
return result

Configuration

sampleRate: Sampling rate for signal generation (default: 1000 Hz).
windowSize: Signal window size (default: 128).
logger: Custom QuantumTCCLogger instance for logging.

Use Cases

Cybersecurity: Detect anomalies in network traffic with secure, decentralized logging.
IoT Monitoring: Analyze sensor data for deviations using AI.
Automated Workflows: Convert natural language instructions into secure, executable workflows.
Audit Systems: Maintain tamper-proof logs with quantum-resistant security.
